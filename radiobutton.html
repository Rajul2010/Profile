<!--Here we have three <input> elements of type radio, with some new attributes as well.
* There’s also a new <label> element for each <input> element.
Let’s review each thing we added to the code.

*First, the id attribute is a unique identifier for the <input> tag.
 It can be used as a CSS selector for the radio button element.
 It also unites the button with its corresponding <label>.

*As mentioned, radio buttons come in groups.
 Use the required name attribute to group together a set of related radio buttons.
 In the above example, all <input>s share the same value for name, so they are treated as part of the same group.
This lets users only choose one option in a group at a time.

*Next, the value attribute represents a unique value for the radio button.
Users don’t see it, but this is submitted to represent the chosen option.
For example, if the form above was submitted with the “17 years or younger” item selected, the system processing the form would receive the value age=child.
If the user does not select any radio button, no value will be sent.
If the value attribute is missing for the selected option,the form will send the default value on.

*Note that <input> tags only create the radio button element, not the label.
To label a radio button, add a <label> element after the <input> element and insert a for attribute with the same value as the id of the associated <input> element.
Then, write your label text in the <label> tag.

*While using <label> isn’t strictly necessary, it’s considered a best practice for two reasons.
First, the semantically rich <label> element makes your website more accessible for people using screen readers.
It tells them which label is paired with which radio button.
Second, the for attribute lets users select a radio button by clicking the label itself in addition to the button, making your form easier to use.-->
